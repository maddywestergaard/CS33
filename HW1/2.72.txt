A. The if statement always returns true because sizeof returns an unsigned value, so it's never less than 0. Adding a signed and unsigned value will default to an unsigned addition, so it won't be less than 0.

B. We could fix it by casting the sizeof() function to int as shown:

void copy_int(int val, void *buf, int maxbytes)
{
    if (maxbytes - (int)sizeof(val) >= 0)
        memcpy(buf, (void*) &val, sizeof(val));
}
