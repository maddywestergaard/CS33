1. I ran gdb without the disassemble, using si to step into each line and keeping
track of the variables. Towards the end of the function, the following line was outputted:

make_number (n=-2305843009802285360) at ../../emacs-26.1/src/lisp.h:944
944	  return lisp_h_make_number (n);

Which sets the answer to the correct value ( stored in n). Then, the lines after
changes the value to 9223372034500410178.

which corresponds to the line in the assembly code:
54e014	48 8d 04 ad 02 00 00 00	lea    0x2(,%rbp,4),%rax

This instruction overflowed and returned the incorrect value to rax.

2.
in data.c:
DEFVAR_LISP ("most-negative-fixnum", Vmost_negative_fixnum,
               doc: /* The smallest value that is representable in a Lisp integer.  */);
  Vmost_negative_fixnum = make_number (MOST_NEGATIVE_FIXNUM);

from lisp.h I found the following declarations:
#define MOST_POSITIVE_FIXNUM (EMACS_INT_MAX >> INTTYPEBITS)
#define MOST_NEGATIVE_FIXNUM (-1 - MOST_POSITIVE_FIXNUM)

#define EMACS_INT_MAX LONG_MAX

INTTYPEBITS = GCTYPEBITS - 1,

#define GCTYPEBITS 3

Therefore,
most-negative-fixnum = -1 - MOST_POSTITIVE_FIXNUM
= -1- (EMACS_INTMAX >> INTTYPEBITS)
= - 1 - (LONG_MAX >> (3-1))
= -1 - (LONG_MAX>>2)
= -2305843009213693952

3.
I debugged the expression:
emacs -Q -batch -eval '(print (* most-positive-fixnum most-positive-fixnum most-positive-fixnum most-positive-fixnum))'

There was a line that says:
overflow |= INT_MULTIPLY_WRAPV (accum, next, &accum);

so then I went to the directory for emacs and ran the following code to get all instances of
INT_MULIPLY_WRAPV:

find . -exec grep "INT_MULTIPLY_WRAPV" '{}' \; -print

And found the declaration for INT_MULTIPLY_WRAPV:
bool overflow = INT_MULTIPLY_WRAPV (a, b, &result);
#define INT_MULTIPLY_WRAPV(a, b, r) \
./lib/intprops.h

so then I went into intprops.h to find it and found this comment which explains the behavior:
/* Compute A + B, A - B, A * B, respectively, storing the result into *R.                                
   Return 1 if the result overflows.  See above for restrictions.  */

4. The function would never overflow which is good, but the result wouldnt be accurate
since it would wrap around whenever overflow would occur. This may cause problems if
the result has to be accurate.
