entered into gdb for this executable

(gdb) set disassemble-next-line-on
(gdb) set logging on	//puts all the debug info into a file
(gdb) b Ftimes    //sets breakpoint at Ftimes
(gdb) r emacs -Q -batch -eval '(print (* 1250284240 -1844255039))' // runs the multiplication

(gdb) si	    // next step of assembly
(gdb) info registers // gets the info for all the registers
(gdb) x 0x[memlocation]     // gets the value at that mem location-only necessary when the memory is being changed

above steps are repeated until return q
Then enter into the log text file, gdb.txt
reformat according to the spec
